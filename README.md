# Welcome to Relisia
## Your job, the bounty on the Emperor's head 

You are a mercenary not from here, arrving in town on a contract from the thieves guild. You must take the necessary choices to assassinate the emperor or learn about the country's history and question your morals by dropping the contract altogether in this interactive story.

## Requirements

GCC compiler

## This program is written in C and must be run on a command prompt.

### Personal Note

This is my first actual git project. I am trying to make a full working program in C and this is more of a learning experience.
If you wish to help me in my project by adding your own storylines and quest, please feel free to do so.
