# Welcome to Relisia
## Your job, the bounty on the Emperor's head 

You are a mercenary not from here, arrving in town on a contract from the thieves guild. You must take the necessary choices to assassinate the emperor or learn about the country's history and question your morals by dropping the contract altogether in this interactive story.

## This project has been discontinued
Since this was more of a learning experience than an actual project, I will not be completing the story as 
I don't have time to spare on writing storylines. 

## Requirements

GCC compiler

## This program is written in C and must be run on a command prompt.

Following commands need to be executed in a terminal to run the program

```bash
cd [[location of the file "textadv.c"]]

textadv
```

### Personal Note

This is my first actual git project.
If you wish to help me in my project by adding your own storylines and quest, please feel free to do so.
